# firecode.io
Challenges from the data structure and algorithm practice tool [firecode.io](https://www.firecode.io/).

The completed solutions incorporate best practices including:
* clear, readable code
* sensible variable names
* abstraction to helper functions
* descriptive docstrings consistent with style guide

Some challenges have multiple solutions available to explore design choices such as iteration *vs.* recursion or time *vs.* space complexity trade-offs.

Code is formatted to the [Google Python Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) format (rev 2.59) and [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
